He was in a joyous state that day. The morning breeze slapping his cheeks lifted his spirit above the existentialist angst. He tied the shoelaces of his new Puma running shoes and started to stroll in the street. He noticed his dear friend the priest not so far away and was eager to catch up with him. He followed him for some time and stopped to observe his friend. 

The priest stopped near a sick homeless man. He pitied his state; so, he kneeled in front of him and prayed to his better state. After blessing the sick, the went on his journey. The atheist was intrigued by this incident. He did not expect this behavior from his priest friend in the least. ‘Looks like he is running away from his social responsibility by praying. He pretends to have pity for the sick, but instead of offering help, he just shows off.’ Thought the atheist.

The atheist went to the sick man, he pitied him too. So, he bought some food from the nearby shop and gave it to the homeless man. He also gave him some money in cash to pay for his treatment. The sick man blessed him with grace of God. The atheist smiled and started to jog again. 

At some distance, the priest again came into his view. He was praying for another homeless person. The atheist was puzzled at first but then started to curse the priest. ‘Why won’t he provide the poor people with some assistance instead of pretending to care for them?’, thought he. After the priest had left, he went to the homeless and bought him food and clothes from a nearby store. The homeless blessed him with the grace of God. The atheist smiled and went on jogging his way. 

The priest showed up again and prayed for another homeless man. The atheist repeated the same process. With each step, he was growing a frustration for the priest. The process repeated for two more times and the atheist was having no more. He decided to confront the priest. 

The atheist called his friend and went up to him. The priest, who was much taller, looked at him with the everlasting kind eyes. “I didn’t see you, my dear.”

“Why are you doing this? If you really care for the homeless people, why don’t you provide them financial assistant, or service maybe. You are escaping social responsibility by pretending to care for them. I expected better from you.”, cried the atheist. 

“What did you do?”, the priest asked gracefully. 

The atheist answered with pride, “I provided them with food and another financial aid they needed, like a good person should do. I am not like you, who will run away from their duties for the world.”

To the atheist’s surprise, the priest rejoiced at this. He opened his arms, looked at the sky and cried- “My Lord! I knew thee won’t let my prayers go in vain.”
